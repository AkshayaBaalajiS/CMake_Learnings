What YOU must do in CMake
🔹 Parent CMake

minimum version

project()

include directory

add_subdirectory(src)

add_subdirectory(app)

🔹 src/CMakeLists.txt

Create a shared library:

add_library(stringutils SHARED string_utils.cpp)


Output will be:

libstringutils.so

🔹 app/CMakeLists.txt

create executable

link with the shared library

handle include directories if needed

⚠️ IMPORTANT about shared libraries

When you run the executable:

./output


You may get:

error while loading shared libraries: libstringutils.so


This is normal for beginners.

You must add:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../src:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Or fix it inside CMake later (RPATH).

🧪 Expected Program Output
Upper : HELLO WORLD
Lower : hello world


Write all 3 CMakeLists:

Parent

src/CMakeLists

app/CMakeLists

Build it.
Run it (set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if needed).

After you're done, show me your CMakeLists and console output.

Then we move to LEVEL 1 → PART 7: RPATH handling + Running shared libs without export.
