How to create a static library (.a file)

How to link that library with your executable

Folder structure with lib/, include/, and src/

└── CMakeLists.txt           ← parent CMake

You must:

set minimum version

set project name

include directories

add subdirectories: src and app

🔹 Child CMakeLists inside src/

You must:

create a static library

library name must be: mathutils

use add_library(mathutils STATIC ...)

add the .cpp file to the library

🔹 Child CMakeLists inside app/

You must:

create an executable

link the static library

print the output
