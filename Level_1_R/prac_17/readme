This is PRAC_17

🔹 Line 1
set(ALGO_MODE "SAFE" CACHE STRING "Algorithm mode: SAFE or FAST")


This line does FOUR things at once.

1️⃣ ALGO_MODE

➡️ This is the variable name.

Think of it as:

“I want a variable called ALGO_MODE.”

2️⃣ "SAFE"

➡️ This is the default value.

Meaning:

If the user does nothing, ALGO_MODE will be "SAFE".

So:

cmake ..


means:

ALGO_MODE = SAFE

3️⃣ CACHE

➡️ This is the most important word here.

Meaning:

“Store this variable in CMake’s cache so the user can change it from the command line.”

Without CACHE:

-DALGO_MODE=FAST ❌ will NOT work

The variable would exist only during this run

With CACHE:

The value is stored in CMakeCache.txt

User can override it using -D

4️⃣ STRING

➡️ This is the type of the cache variable.

Meaning:

Value is text

Not ON/OFF

Not a number

So valid values are things like:

SAFE
FAST
DEBUG
GPU

5️⃣ "Algorithm mode: SAFE or FAST"

➡️ This is a description for humans.

Where it appears:

ccmake

cmake-gui

Helps users understand the variable

It does nothing to logic.

🔑 Final meaning of line 1 (plain English)

“Create a configurable string variable named ALGO_MODE,
default it to SAFE,
allow the user to change it with -D,
and describe what it means.”



// ON PARENT CMAKE :
set(VAR_NAME "DEFAULT_VALUE" CACHE STRING "Description of that variaable ")

if(VAR_NAME STREQUAL VALUE)
option(MACRO "Be fefault set to" ON / OFF )
endif()

// ON terminal 
cmake -DVAR_NAME=VALUE ..
