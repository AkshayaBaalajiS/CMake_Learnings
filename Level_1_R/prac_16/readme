instead of option and the macro we will gove to turn on or off 

now we are giving the string directly

You now know option() (BOOL) — the next step is STRING options in CMake.

I’ll explain what it is, why it exists, and how YOU should use it (conceptually, not dumping code).

🔑 What is a STRING option in CMake?

A STRING option lets the user choose one value from many possibilities,
instead of just ON / OFF.

Think of it as:

mode selection

backend selection

algorithm selection

platform selection

🧠 Compare BOOL vs STRING (very important)
Type	User can choose
option()	ON / OFF
STRING	Any text value

Examples:

DEBUG, RELEASE

FAST, SAFE

OPENSSL, MBEDTLS

TCP, UDP

🔍 When should you use STRING instead of option()?

Ask yourself:

❓ Are there more than 2 valid choices?

If YES → use STRING

If NO → use option()

🧱 How STRING variables are defined (conceptually)

In the parent CMakeLists.txt, you:

Create a variable

Put it in the CACHE

Give it a default value

Describe allowed values (for humans)

This makes it configurable via -D.

🧪 How user passes a STRING value

From command line:

cmake -DMODE=FAST ..


or

cmake -DALGORITHM=SAFE ..

🧠 Important difference from option()

option() automatically creates a BOOL cache variable

STRING must be explicitly cached

STRING values are not validated automatically

So:

User can type anything — YOU must handle it
